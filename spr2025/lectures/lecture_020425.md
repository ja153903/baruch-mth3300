# Python Lab Exercise: Arithmetic, Logical, and Relational Operators  

## **Task 3: Logical Operators**  

Write a Python program that demonstrates the use of logical operators (`and`, `or`, `not`).  

1. Ask the user to input two boolean values (`True` or `False`) for `bool1` and `bool2`.  
2. Perform the following logical operations and display the results:  
   - `bool1 and bool2`  
   - `bool1 or bool2`  
   - `not bool1`  
   - `not bool2`  

**Example Output:**  

```text
Enter the first boolean value (True/False): True  
Enter the second boolean value (True/False): False  
True and False: False  
True or False: True  
not True: False  
not False: True  
```

# Python Lab Exercise: Arithmetic, Logical, and Relational Operators  

## **Task 4: Combined Operations**  

Write a Python program that combines arithmetic, relational, and logical operators.  

1. Ask the user to input three numbers, `a`, `b`, and `c`.  
2. Perform the following operations:  
   - Check if `a` is greater than `b` and `b` is greater than `c`.  
   - Check if `a` is equal to `b` or `b` is equal to `c`.  
   - Check if the sum of `a` and `b` is greater than `c`.  
   - Check if `a` is not equal to `c`.  

**Example Output:**  

```text
Enter the first number: 10  
Enter the second number: 5  
Enter the third number: 2  
Is a > b > c? True  
Is a == b or b == c? False  
Is (a + b) > c? True  
Is a != c? True  
```
